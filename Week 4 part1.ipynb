    "The city of New York is described as the most populous city in the United States (US) with an estimated population of 8.3 million people as at 2017. Located in the state of New York, New York City (NYC) is the center of the New York Metropolitan Area, the largest urban population area in the world by landmass. \n",
    "\n",
    "NYC consists of five boroughs: Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, The Bronx and Staten Island and is home to more than 3.2 million people born outside of the US. Given NYC's multi-cultural make-up and equally diverse culinary scene, it is the aim of this exercise to obtain and explore data regarding the neighborhoods in NYC in order to determine the optimum location to establish the first of a franchise chain of dedicated Caribbean cuisine restaurants. The success of the first establishment will determine the opening of other restaurant locations within the franchise chain. \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, thousands of restaurants exist in NYC with varied menu offerings. The opening of a restaurant is a significant undertaking with a potentially huge profit, the success of which is dependent on choice of location including parking, accessibility and visibility, demand, population and neighboring competition. . There is a host of information available which may overwhelm an entrepreneur or investor. The cost of hiring a team of consultants to assist with the decision-making process may also be burdensome.  As part of formulating a business plan, data science methodologies will be applied to determine the most favorable NYC neighborhood to open the first restaurant of the Caribbean Cuisine franchise, with the following criteria in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Proximity to main roads and/or highways (central location)\n",
    "2. Public and private transport access and pedestrian traffic\n",
    "3. Security of area\n",
    "4. Access to parking lot\n",
    "5. Service menu competition\n",
    "6. Proximity to farmer's markets to obtain fresh produce daily \n",
    "7. Proximity to other vendors and suppliers \n",
    "8. Visibility of at least one historical landmark\n",
    "9. Proximity to highly populated neighborhoods\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of Foursquare location data and other dependencies will allow for potential investors to assess the feasibility of the proposal for a new restaurant presented by a budding young chef. The investors are willing to support a venture in a high-traffic neighborhood that is easily accessible and with minimal competition. "
